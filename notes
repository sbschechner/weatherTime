notes

to use mateiral UI, need to npm material UI

and need to add react plug in tap to dependencies



will need to do something like when you hit submit on add city, that section changes to a button saying, add another? or disappears?

netlify deploy -p ./build

^^^ have to npm run build first



Next Steps:

Should call WeatherTime App - Morning Start 
	Icon will be cups of coffee
	Need to add splash will also be a cup of coffee 
	The Weather Time app is a place where you can start all the things you need
		Maybe add set an alarm feature?
